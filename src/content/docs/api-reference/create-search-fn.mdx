title: createSearchFn
---

The `createSearchFn` utility function streamlines the search implementation process by managing index fetching and search functionality in a single operation.

## Type Definition

```typescript
type SearchFn = (query: string) => Promise<SearchResult[] | StaticSeekError>;
type SearchFnCallback = (isLoading: boolean) => void;

export function createSearchFn(url: string, callback: SearchFnCallback = () => {}): SearchFn;
```

## Parameters

- `url`: The endpoint URL for fetching the search index. The endpoint must return a JSON-formatted index.
- `callback`: An optional function that receives a boolean parameter indicating the index loading state. This callback is invoked with `true` when index loading begins and `false` when loading completes, enabling integration with loading indicators or other UI elements.

## Return Value

Returns a `SearchFn` function that is compatible with the standard [search](/api-reference/search) function, with one key difference: the returned function includes the `StaticSeekIndex` in its closure. This eliminates the need to provide an index when invoking the `SearchFn`.

The index loading process begins automatically upon the first invocation of the returned `SearchFn`.

## Usage

```typescript
import { createSearchFn } from "staticseek";

const search_function = createSearchFn(index_url);
const result = await search_function("search word");
```

## Error Handling

While `createSearchFn` itself doesn't return `StaticSeekError`, the returned `SearchFn` may produce a `StaticSeekError` when called. Therefore, implement error handling for the `SearchFn` return value as you would for the standard `search` function.
