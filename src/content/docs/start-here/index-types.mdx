title: Index Types
---

StaticSeek offers several index types to optimize search performance based on your specific needs:

- **LinearIndex**: 
  - **Description**: The standard implementation and default choice for most applications.
  - **Use Case**: Best suited for small to medium-sized datasets where quick exact matches are required.
  - **Performance**: Provides reliable performance but may degrade with larger datasets.

- **GPULinearIndex**: 
  - **Description**: A WebGPU-accelerated implementation that enhances search speed for fuzzy queries.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for applications with GPU support that require fast fuzzy search capabilities.
  - **Performance**: Achieves significant speed improvements, especially for larger datasets, while maintaining accuracy.

- **HybridTrieBigramInvertedIndex**: 
  - **Description**: A high-performance implementation designed for larger datasets, utilizing a combination of Trie and bigram indexing.
  - **Use Case**: Best for applications that require fast search performance across multilingual datasets.
  - **Performance**: Offers substantial speed improvements but may introduce higher false positive rates for languages like Japanese and reduced accuracy in fuzzy searches.

### Choosing the Right Index

When selecting an index type, consider the following factors:
- **Dataset Size**: For smaller datasets, `LinearIndex` may suffice. For larger datasets, consider `GPULinearIndex` or `HybridTrieBigramInvertedIndex`.
- **Search Requirements**: If fuzzy search is a priority, `GPULinearIndex` is recommended. For precise searches in CJK languages, `HybridTrieBigramInvertedIndex` may be more suitable.
- **Hardware Availability**: Ensure that your deployment environment supports the necessary hardware for GPU acceleration if choosing `GPULinearIndex`.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each index type, you can make informed decisions that enhance the search experience for your users.
