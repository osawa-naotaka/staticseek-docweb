staticseek can be integrated into various frameworks to enhance search functionality. Example implementations are available for:

- **Next.js**
  - [Basic Example](https://github.com/osawa-naotaka/staticseek/tree/main/example/next/01.basic)
  - [Preindexed on-demand loading](https://github.com/osawa-naotaka/staticseek/tree/main/example/next/02.preindexed)

- **Astro**
  - [Basic Example](https://github.com/osawa-naotaka/staticseek/tree/main/example/astro/01.basic)
  - [Preindexed on-demand loading](https://github.com/osawa-naotaka/staticseek/tree/main/example/astro/02.preindexed)

- **Nuxt**
  - [Basic Example](https://github.com/osawa-naotaka/staticseek/tree/main/example/nuxt/01.basic)
  - [Preindexed on-demand loading](https://github.com/osawa-naotaka/staticseek/tree/main/example/nuxt/02.preindexed)

## Integration with Next.js

To integrate staticseek with Next.js, follow these steps:

1. **Install staticseek**:
   ```bash
   npm install staticseek
   ```

2. **Create an Index**: Use the `createIndex` function to create an index from your data.

3. **Implement Search Functionality**: Use the `search` function to perform searches based on user input.

### Error Handling

When integrating staticseek, it is important to handle potential errors. For example, if the index cannot be created or if a search fails, a `staticseekError` will be returned. Ensure to check for this error and handle it appropriately in your application.

## Integration with Astro

To integrate staticseek with Astro, follow these steps:

1. **Install staticseek**:
   ```bash
   npm install staticseek
   ```

2. **Create a Static Index**: Set up a static index file to pre-generate your search index.

3. **Implement Search Functionality**: Use the `createSearchFn` function to create a search function that fetches the index and performs searches.

### Error Handling

As with Next.js, ensure to handle potential errors during the integration process. Check for `StaticSeekError` when creating the index or performing searches.

## Integration with Nuxt

To integrate staticseek with Nuxt, follow these steps:

1. **Install staticseek**:
   ```bash
   npm install staticseek
   ```

2. **Create an Index**: Similar to the other frameworks, create an index from your data.

3. **Implement Search Functionality**: Use the `search` function to perform searches based on user input.

### Error Handling

Handle errors appropriately, checking for `StaticSeekError` during index creation and search operations.

By following these integration guides, you can effectively implement staticseek in your applications, enhancing the search experience for your users.
