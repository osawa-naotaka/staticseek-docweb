staticseek is a client-side full-text search engine designed specifically for static websites. It enables searching through arrays of JavaScript objects containing strings or string arrays. By converting your articles into JavaScript objects, you can implement full-text search functionality on static sites without any server-side implementation.

## Quick Start

### Install staticseek

Install staticseek to your project by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="pkg">
<TabItem label="npm">
```sh
npm install staticseek
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm">
```sh
pnpm install staticseek
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Yarn">
```sh
yarn add staticseek
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip[Alternative method]
You can directly import staticseek using [jsDelivr's CDN service](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/staticseek).

### Perform Indexing and Searching

Create an index and run searches with that index by providing search terms as arguments. Here, `array_of_articles` represents an array of JavaScript objects containing the text to be searched.

<Tabs syncKey="code-example">
<TabItem label="search.ts">
```typescript
import { LinearIndex, createIndex, search, StaticSeekError } from "staticseek";
import { array_of_articles } from "array_of_articles";

// Create an index
const index = createIndex(LinearIndex, array_of_articles);
if (index instanceof StaticSeekError) throw index;

// Perform a search
const result = await search(index, "search word");
if (result instanceof StaticSeekError) throw result;
for (const r of result) {
    console.log(array_of_articles[r.id]);
}
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="array_of_articles.ts">
```typescript
export const array_of_articles = [
    {
        slug: "introduction-to-js",
        content: "JavaScript is a versatile programming language widely used for web development...",
        data: {
            title: "Introduction to JavaScript",
            description: "Learn the basics of JavaScript, a powerful language for modern web applications.",
            tags: ["javascript", "web", "programming"]
        }
    },
    // ...
];
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The search results are returned as an array, sorted by score (relevance). The `id` field in each result contains the array index of the matching document.
