title: Query Syntax

## Fuzzy Search
By default, staticseek performs fuzzy search with an edit distance of 1,
meaning it tolerates one character error per search term. You can adjust this tolerance in two ways:

For individual searches, specify the edit distance in the query:
```
distance:2 searchterm    // Allows up to 2 character differences
```

Spaces between "distance:" and "2" is not allowed.

To set a different default edit distance for all searches, configure it during index creation:
```javascript
const index = createIndex(LinearIndex, array_of_articles, {
    distance: 2  // Set default edit distance for all searches
});
```

## Exact Match Search
Use double quotes for exact phrase matching:
```
"exact phrase"    // Matches the exact phrase including spaces
```
Use `\"` to include double quotes in the search term.


## Boolean Operations
- **AND Search**: Space-separated terms (both terms must match)
  ```
  term1 term2    // Documents containing both terms
  ```

- **OR Search**: Terms separated by OR (either term can match)
  ```
  term1 OR term2    // Documents containing either term
  ```

- **NOT Search**: Terms prefixed with minus (exclude documents with term)
  ```
  -term1 term2    // Documents with term2 but without term1
  ```
  Note: NOT search must be used with AND search; standalone NOT terms are ignored.

## Field-Specific Search
Limit search to specific fields:
```
from:title searchterm    // Search only in title field
```

## Score Weighting
Adjust relevance scoring for specific terms:
```
from:title weight:2.5 searchterm    // Increase title matches' weight by 2.5x
```
