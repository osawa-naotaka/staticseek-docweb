title: Query Result
---

Quere results are returned as an array of `SearchResult` objects:

```typescript
export type SearchResult = {
    id: number;
    key: Record<string, unknown>;
    score: number;
    refs: Reference[];
};
```

- **id**: The index position of the matching document in the original array.
- **key**: An object containing the specified fields from the original document. For example, if `['slug', 'data.title']` were set as `key_fields`, the result would include `{ slug: "matching slug", data: { title: "matching title" } }`.
- **score**: A TF-IDF-based relevance score, where higher scores indicate stronger matches. Scores decrease proportionally to edit distance in fuzzy searches.
- **refs**: An array of `Reference` objects containing details on the match locations.

```typescript
export type Reference = {
    token: string;
    path: Path;
    pos?: number;
    wordaround?: string;
    distance: number;
};
```

- **token**: The specific search term that matched.
- **path**: The field where the match was found.
- **pos**: The position of the match within the text (character index from the beginning of the field). For fuzzy matches, slight shifts may occur due to insertions/deletions.
- **wordaround**: A snippet of text surrounding the match for better context.
- **distance**: The edit distance for fuzzy search matches.
